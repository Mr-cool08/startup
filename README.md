# startup
you most have every script on the destop exept for "extra_password.vbs" it need to be in "C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"
this script work best with a swedish computer
you need to install minecraft on the destop
you need to edit the script so the patterns match
if the script dont work change everywere the it stands "%user%" to your username
